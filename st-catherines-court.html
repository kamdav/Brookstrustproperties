                  <p>Will originally became a Lancaster landlord in 1979.&nbsp;  However, career pressures meant that he and his initial business partner had to cease their rentals business during the 1980s, even though the enterprise itself was successful.&nbsp;  15 years later he returned, when a friend (who is now his co-director) won a place in Lancaster herself and complained that she had nowhere to live!</p>

                <div class="content" id="panel8">
                  <p>After graduating in 1977 (Fylde, BA (2.1), Economics and Financial Control), Will returned to London.&nbsp;  He qualified as a Chartered Accountant, with one of the leading firms, in 1980.&nbsp;  He then made his career in the banking and securities industries in the City.&nbsp;  He established his own consulting firm, Eximus Capital, in 1990 and runs the properties, in part, from Eximus Capital’s office in London.</p>

                  <p>Will is a past President of the London Society of Chartered Accountants.&nbsp;  He now serves as a member of Council, the supreme governing body for the Institute of Chartered Accountants in England and Wales (ICAEW).&nbsp;  He is also a member of the ICAEW Board.</p>

                  <p>His business interests include being a director of a diving and watersports store in London; and he is a trustee of a multi academy trust (7 schools).</p>

                <div class="content" id="panel9">
                  <p>For the past 15 years, Will has been active in directly supporting Lancaster University.&nbsp;  He is a member of Court, one of the University’s governing bodies; and keeps in touch with University affairs.&nbsp;  Well over half of Will’s London employees so far have been Lancaster graduates.</p>

                  <p>He is now a member of the Dean’s Council at Lancaster University Management School.</p>

                <div class="content" id="panel10">
                  <p>Will is a member of the National Landlords Association, one of the professional bodies in the lettings industry.&nbsp;  In Lancaster, he serves on the steering group for the Residential Property Accreditation Scheme for Lancaster City Council – an important contribution to housing standards.</p>

                <div class="content" id="panel11">
                  <p>Will still runs his consultancy firm, but his success in Lancaster means that he now devotes rather more of his time to his lettings business than he had ever planned.&nbsp;  He now maintains a permanent home in the area, as there is plenty to do!</p>

                <div class="content" id="panel12">
                  <p>Will does this work not just to earn part of his living, but also because he enjoys it.&nbsp;  He believes strongly that, for students, good housing is a fundamental factor in promoting good academic performance.</p>

                  <p>As Will says, a good house on its own will not get you a good degree – you still have to work, unfortunately – but bad housing can make your studies much more difficult.&nbsp;  A good place to live is well worth paying extra for.</p>
